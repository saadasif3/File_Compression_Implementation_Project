# File_Compression_Implementation_Project
This is a University semester project, created by Saad Asif (Student of BSCS 5th semester).
This is a basic compress file maker project created in python that will read a text file and convert it into cmpressed form.
To add file for comression, place the path of the file in the code. Also the path of the output folder where you want to store compressed and decompressed files.
For any queries, feel to contact.
Thank youo!
